## Functional vs. Imperative Programming

### What is Functional Programming?

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

### Key Differences from Imperative Programming:

| Functional Programming | Imperative Programming |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Emphasizes expressions and declarations | Emphasizes statements and commands |
| Avoids state changes and mutable data | Relies on state changes to perform operations |
| Uses recursion for iteration | Uses loops for iteration |
| Declarative (what to do) | Imperative (how to do it) |
| Functions are first-class citizens | Functions are procedures |

### Example Comparison:

**Imperative approach (in Python):**
```python
def sum_list(numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        total += number
    return total
```

**Functional approach (in Haskell):**
```haskell
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList [] = 0
sumList (x:xs) = x + sumList xs

-- Or using built-in functions:
sumList' :: [Int] -> Int
sumList' = sum
```

### Why It Matters:
Functional programming makes it easier to:
- Reason about code
- Test and debug programs
- Write concurrent applications
- Avoid many common bugs related to state management

---

## Pure Functions

### What is a Pure Function?

A pure function is a function that:
1. Always returns the same result given the same inputs (referential transparency)
2. Has no side effects (doesn't modify state outside its scope)
3. Doesn't depend on external state

### Example in Haskell:

```haskell
-- Pure function
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y

-- This will always return 7 when given 3 and 4
-- add 3 4 == 7
```

### Counter-example (non-pure function in an imperative language):

```javascript
let total = 0;

// Impure function (modifies external state)
function addToTotal(x) {
    total += x;
    return total;
}

// addToTotal(5) gives 5
// addToTotal(5) gives 10 (different result for same input)
```

### Benefits of Pure Functions:
- Easier to test and debug
- Can be memoized (cached) for performance
- Can be evaluated in any order or in parallel
- Leads to more maintainable code

---

## Immutability

### What is Immutability?

Immutability means that once a value is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of modifying existing values, functional programming creates new values based on existing ones.

### Benefits of Immutability:

1. **Thread Safety**: Immutable data can be safely shared between threads without locks.
2. **Easier Reasoning**: No need to track changes to values over time.
3. **Simpler Debugging**: The state at any point is predictable.
4. **Facilitates Persistent Data Structures**: Efficient implementation of data structures that preserve previous versions.

### Example in Haskell:

```haskell
-- Original list
original = [1, 2, 3]

-- Creating a new list, original remains unchanged
addElement :: [a] -> a -> [a]
addElement xs x = xs ++ [x]

-- Usage:
-- newList = addElement original 4
-- newList is [1, 2, 3, 4]
-- original is still [1, 2, 3]
```

### Handling State Changes:

Instead of mutating state, functional programs often use techniques like:
- Recursion with accumulator parameters
- State monads (for more advanced use cases)
- Persistent data structures

---

## Recursion vs. Loops

### What is Recursion?

Recursion is a method where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem.

### Why Recursion in Haskell Instead of Loops?

1. Haskell doesn't have traditional loop constructs (`for`, `while`) as they require mutable state.
2. Recursion naturally fits with immutable data and mathematical definitions.
3. Haskell optimizes well-written recursion with tail-call optimization.

### Basic Recursion Example:

```haskell
-- Factorial using recursion
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

-- Usage:
-- factorial 5 == 120
```

### Tail Recursion Example:

```haskell
-- Factorial using tail recursion
factorialTail :: Integer -> Integer
factorialTail n = helper n 1
  where
    helper 0 acc = acc
    helper n acc = helper (n - 1) (n * acc)
```

### Recursive Patterns in Haskell:

Many common operations are already implemented as higher-order functions:
- `map` for transforming each element
- `filter` for selecting elements
- `fold` (or `reduce`) for accumulating values

---

## Variables in Functional Programming

### How Haskell Handles Variables:

In Haskell, "variables" are actually constants - once defined, they cannot change value.

### Key Differences:

| Haskell Variables | Imperative Variables |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Immutable bindings to values | Mutable storage locations |
| Cannot be reassigned | Can be reassigned |
| More like mathematical variables | More like memory locations |
| Defined with pattern matching | Assigned with assignment statements |

### Example:

```haskell
-- In Haskell, x is bound to 5 forever in this scope
x = 5

-- This is a new definition, not a reassignment
y = x + 1

-- In a function, parameters are also immutable
increment :: Int -> Int
increment n = n + 1  -- n cannot be changed within the function
```

### How to Handle Changing Values:

Instead of mutating variables, Haskell:
1. Creates new values based on existing ones
2. Uses recursion with different parameter values
3. Passes state explicitly through function calls

---

## Pattern Matching

### What is Pattern Matching?

Pattern matching is a mechanism for checking a value against a pattern and, based on the match, destructuring the value into its constituent parts.

### Basic Example:

```haskell
-- Pattern matching on a list
isEmpty :: [a] -> Bool
isEmpty [] = True
isEmpty _  = False

-- Pattern matching on tuples
fst' :: (a, b) -> a
fst' (x, _) = x

-- Pattern matching in a function with multiple cases
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
```

### More Complex Example:

```haskell
-- Pattern matching with custom data types
data Shape = Circle Float | Rectangle Float Float

area :: Shape -> Float
area (Circle r) = pi * r * r
area (Rectangle w h) = w * h
```

### Benefits of Pattern Matching:
- Makes code more concise and readable
- Provides compile-time checks for missing patterns
- Enables elegant decomposition of complex data structures

---

## Higher-Order Functions

### What is a Higher-Order Function?

A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments and/or returns a function as its result.

### Examples in Haskell:

1. **map**: Applies a function to each element in a list
```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map f []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs

-- Usage:
-- map (*2) [1, 2, 3] == [2, 4, 6]
```

2. **filter**: Selects elements that satisfy a predicate
```haskell
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
filter p []     = []
filter p (x:xs) = if p x then x : filter p xs else filter p xs

-- Usage:
-- filter even [1, 2, 3, 4] == [2, 4]
```

3. **foldr/foldl**: Reduce a list to a single value
```haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f z []     = z
foldr f z (x:xs) = f x (foldr f z xs)

-- Usage:
-- foldr (+) 0 [1, 2, 3] == 6
```

4. **Function composition**: Creates a new function from existing ones
```haskell
(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
(f . g) x = f (g x)

-- Usage:
-- let addThenDouble = (*2) . (+1)
-- addThenDouble 3 == 8
```

### Why Higher-Order Functions Matter:
- Enable code reuse and abstraction
- Allow for more declarative programming
- Facilitate creating domain-specific languages
- Form the backbone of many functional programming patterns

---

## The Map Function

### What Does the Map Function Do?

The `map` function applies a given function to each element of a list, returning a new list with the transformed elements.

### Definition:

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map _ []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
```

### Examples:

```haskell
-- Double each number
map (*2) [1, 2, 3, 4]
-- Result: [2, 4, 6, 8]

-- Convert to string
map show [1, 2, 3, 4]
-- Result: ["1", "2", "3", "4"]

-- Apply a custom function
map (\x -> x * x + 1) [1, 2, 3]
-- Result: [2, 5, 10]

-- Using map with a named function
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x

map square [1, 2, 3, 4]
-- Result: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### Map in Other Contexts:

In Haskell, `map` generalizes beyond lists to any `Functor`:

```haskell
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- For Maybe:
fmap (+1) (Just 3)  -- Just 4
fmap (+1) Nothing   -- Nothing

-- For Either:
fmap (+1) (Right 3) -- Right 4
fmap (+1) (Left "error") -- Left "error"
```

### Implementing Map Yourself:

```haskell
myMap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
myMap _ []     = []
myMap f (x:xs) = f x : myMap f xs
```

---

## Lazy Evaluation

### What is Lazy Evaluation?

Lazy evaluation (or call-by-need) is an evaluation strategy that delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed.

### Significance in Haskell:

1. **Infinite Data Structures**: Can work with conceptually infinite lists
2. **Performance Optimization**: Only computes what's actually needed
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Define what to compute separately from when to compute it
4. **Control Structures**: Enables custom control structures as regular functions

### Examples:

```haskell
-- Infinite list of natural numbers
naturals = [1..]

-- Taking the first 5 elements
take 5 naturals  -- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

-- Creating infinite fibonacci sequence
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

-- Taking first 10 fibonacci numbers
take 10 fibs  -- [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
```

### Short-Circuiting:

```haskell
-- The 'or' function will short-circuit when it finds True
or [False, False, True, undefined]  -- True (undefined is never evaluated)

-- Custom if-then-else
myIf :: Bool -> a -> a -> a
myIf True  thenValue _         = thenValue
myIf False _         elseValue = elseValue
```

### Potential Downsides:

- Memory leaks if not careful
- Less predictable performance characteristics
- "Space leaks" due to unevaluated thunks

---

## Type Inference

### What is Type Inference?

Type inference is the automatic detection of the data type of an expression without explicit type annotations.

### How Type Inference Works in Haskell:

Haskell uses the Hindley-Milner type system, which can infer the most general type for an expression based on how it's used.

### Examples:

```haskell
-- Type is inferred as Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y

-- Type is inferred as [a] -> [a] (polymorphic)
duplicate xs = xs ++ xs

-- With explicit type annotation
sumSquares :: [Int] -> Int
sumSquares xs = sum (map (^2) xs)
```

### Benefits of Type Inference:

1. **Less Boilerplate**: Don't need to write types everywhere
2. **Polymorphism**: Functions can work with any type that fits
3. **Error Detection**: Many errors caught at compile time
4. **Documentation**: Types help understand function behavior

### When to Add Type Annotations:

Even though Haskell can infer types, it's good practice to:
- Add type signatures to top-level functions
- Use signatures to constrain overly general types
- Add annotations when debugging type errors
- Use annotations as documentation

```haskell
-- Without annotation, this would be generic for any Num type
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x
```
